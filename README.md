# Vaultacks

Vaultacks is built on the [Stacks Chain](https://www.stacks.co/). It lets users upload files to [Gaia](https://docs.stacks.co/docs/gaia/), a off-chain data storage system. Vaultacks currently uses the [default provider](https://gaia.blockstack.org/) (you will encounter an error XML file if you visit this link as the root path isn't supposed to show anything). 

Users can wish to make files private or public. Public files are stored as-is and anyone with the Gaia URL can access it. Private files are stored in an encrypted form which can only be decrypted by the wallet with which it was encrypted.

## Features
- Encrypted file storage (files are private by default)
- Ability to store raw text as well
- A way to view all files stored by the user
- File pages from where the user can download the file
- In case of raw text, users can view the text and copy it to the clipboard without downloading anything

## Screenshots
- Home page (displays files when wallet is connected)
